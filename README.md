README for the OpenRelik Worker Template

This file provides instructions on how to use this template to create a new OpenRelik worker.
The placeholder `TEMPLATEWORKERNAME` needs to be replaced with the actual name of your worker.
The `bootstrap.sh` script is designed to help with this process.
-->

1.  **Bootstrap your new worker:**
    Run the `bash bootstrap.sh` script located in the root of this template. This script will guide you through renaming `TEMPLATEWORKERNAME` to your chosen worker name throughout the project files (e.g., directory names, Python files, etc.).
2.  **Update this README:**
    After bootstrapping, manually replace all remaining instances of `TEMPLATEWORKERNAME` in this `README.md` file with your actual worker name. Also, fill in the description section below.
3.  **Write Tests:**
    Before or alongside developing your worker's core logic, start creating tests.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for individual functions and classes within your worker's `src` directory. Place these in the `tests/` directory.
    *   Refer to the "Test" section below for instructions on how to run your tests.
4.  **Implement Worker Logic:**
    Fill in the `src/tasks.py` file (and any other necessary modules) with the core functionality of your worker.
5.  **Add LICENSE file:**
    Add a License file to the repository.
